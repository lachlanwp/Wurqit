# Developers guide

## Introduction

This is an Electron desktop application. All dependencies are bundled with the application, so the end user doesn't need to install additional software (such as FFmpeg) or provide exercise videos.

## Development environment

You will need the following installed on your dev system

- Node 20+
- Yarn
- Git

## File/folder structure of important files/folders

```
 - workout-generator
    - media
        - audio     | contains audio for exercise videos
        - icon      | contains icon files for the app
        - videos    | contains all the exercise videos
        - images    | contains images for the app
    - tests         | contains tests for the main app code
    - .env          | the environment variables used for builds
    - src/
        - generator.ts  | the main TypeScript for generating the videos
        - main.ts       | the entry point of the app
        - preload.ts    | used to preload all the IPC code
        - script.ts     | the UI logic of the app
    - index.html    | the UI of the app
    - notarize.js   | used to notarize the app for release
    - package.json  | npm packages file, contains build config too
```

## Run it locally

Run the following commands

```bash
yarn install
```

```bash
yarn start
```

## Testing

Run the test suite with Jest:

```bash
yarn test
```

Run tests in watch mode:

```bash
yarn test:watch
```

Run tests with coverage:

```bash
yarn test -- --coverage
```

See the [tests/README.md](tests/README.md) for detailed testing information.

## Continuous Integration

This project uses GitHub Actions for continuous integration:

- **Tests**: Automatically runs on every push to `main` and pull request
- **Node.js Versions**: Tests against Node.js 18.x and 20.x
- **Coverage**: Generates coverage reports for each test run
- **Artifacts**: Coverage reports are saved as build artifacts

The test badge above shows the status of the latest test run on the main branch. The badge will appear after the first push to the main branch triggers the GitHub Actions workflow.

## Build for release

You will need to create an `.env` file in the root of the repo with the following contents

```
APPLE_APP_SPECIFIC_PASSWORD=...
APPLE_TEAM_ID=...
APPLE_ID=...
```

Provide your own values in place of `...`

Then run

```bash
yarn build
```
